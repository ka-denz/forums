        <div class="postcontent">  <p>thanks for all the new followers, ive been lurking for a bit now im so excited to be apart of something bigger!!!! NM is the future!!!! ppl were wanting my story so here it is: as i said ive been a lurker and finally something snapped, i had a fight with my mom about school and i knew if i found the video i could do something about it. when i watched at first i didnt notice anything but then i felt like i was reaching some sort of higher understanding. my first course of action was to have it do my homework. some ppl gave tips on their blogs about focusing really hard on the thing you want to manipulate, in my case it was a piece of paper with questions on it so i had to kind of “trace” it back to its origin? at least thats what it felt like i was doing. finally after staring at the paper for almost the whole night THE ANSWERS STARTED TO MATERIALIZE. it was like magic and so here we are now :)
